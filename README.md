# AllStat

This is a database, containing data from Swedish top flight football league, Allsvenskan, from its inaugural season, 1924/25, up until today. 

The database contains the following data points:

* leaguename – the name of the league, and the season it was played.
* matchdate – the date the fixture was played.
* matchday – the round the fixture was played in. In the first years the fixtures weren't as organized, as they are today. This leads to it being a puzzle which games belong to what round. You will find the same team playing more than one game in a single round. If you can lay this puzzle better than I, you are most welcome to make corrections.
* hometeam – the team who were the hosts, although games played at a neutral venue are not indicated.
* awayteam – the visiting team.
* homescore – the number of goals scored by the home team.
* awayscore – the number of goals scored by the visiting team.
* attendance – official spectators, as reported at the time. This reporting has changed throughout the years; first counting only paid entrance fees, not including free tickets etc, now indicating actual number of people watching the game.
